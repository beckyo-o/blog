The blog has a very boring, basic Vercel app design. The entries have no formatting.. I can't even start a new line in this body. And I clearly also have no blog experience :D. So hopefully, by the end of all of this, I'll be more experienced in blogging and web dev hehehe... I was using some kinda <Image> custom element for some reason, which couldn't take image links, so I switched to the default img tag (this will be subject to change?!). Truncated text is truncated really weirdly, I need to fix that. BUT!! Where should I host my images for this project (thinking about Cloudinary)! Instead, here's an image of ducknana in Adobe-converted svg form:",
